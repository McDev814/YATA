This is a very simple python program for managing tasks.

## Use:
- YATA automatically saves all tasks to a file named data.csv in the directory that the program was run from.
    - If YATA is started without providing the file at launch, there will be no tasks available and the data.csv file will be overwritten
- To launch with data, pass data.csv as the first argument parameter when launching YATA
